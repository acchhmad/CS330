Portfolio Reflection – Computational Graphics and Visualization

When designing software, I start by thinking about the user experience and the purpose behind the program. For my 3D scene project, that meant asking how the space should feel and what emotions or atmosphere I wanted to convey before touching any code. Once I had that vision, I broke it down into technical requirements—lighting, textures, camera movement, and object placement—so that each design choice served the overall goal of realism and mood.

Working on this project helped me develop a stronger sense of visual design and spatial reasoning. I learned how important balance and composition are in a 3D world, not just the technical accuracy of models and shaders. Adjusting things like the brightness of a lamp or the angle of a spotlight taught me how subtle details can completely change how a scene feels. I also got better at organizing assets and shader files in a structured way, which made my workflow smoother.

My design process followed an iterative cycle. I began with a simple base scene, then added lighting, textures, and camera controls in layers, testing after each step. I used a combination of the Phong lighting model and different light sources to build depth and realism. Each iteration helped me identify what worked visually and what didn’t, allowing me to refine the scene gradually instead of trying to perfect everything in one pass. This process reminded me that design is not a straight line—it’s a loop of building, testing, and improving.

In future projects, I can apply the same design approach by starting small, focusing on the core functionality first, and layering detail through iteration. This mindset works well in both graphics and broader software development because it keeps projects manageable and adaptable.

When it came to developing the program, I relied on problem-solving and experimentation. I used GLSL shaders to handle lighting and reflection, and I adjusted my camera controls multiple times to achieve a natural sense of movement. Debugging shaders required patience and a clear understanding of how different elements—ambient, diffuse, and specular—interact. Iteration played a big role here too, as each small change often affected the entire look of the scene.

Throughout the milestones, my approach to coding became more organized and deliberate. Early on, I focused on just getting things to render correctly, but by the end, I was thinking more like an engineer—using consistent structure, naming conventions, and reusable code to make updates easier. I learned to value planning as much as creativity.

Computational graphics and visualization have given me new skills that connect both to my education and my professional goals. Understanding how math, lighting equations, and 3D transformations come together visually has deepened my appreciation for computer science as a creative field. These skills translate well to areas like game development, simulation, and digital design, where both logic and artistry matter. As I continue studying computer science, I know that this experience will help me approach technical challenges with a more creative, problem-solving mindset.
